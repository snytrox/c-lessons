# C Language Notes

This repository contains my personal notes and code examples while learning the C programming language.

## Contents
- Variables
- Conditional Statements (if/else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Functions
- Arrays
- Pointers
- Strings
- Structures (`struct`)
- File Handling
- Recursion
- Bitwise Operators
- Dynamic Memory (malloc, calloc, free)

## Purpose
My goal is to learn the fundamentals of C programming and eventually build small projects using what I’ve learned.  
This repository serves both as a study journal and as a public record of my progress.

✍️ _More topics and projects will be added as I continue learning._
